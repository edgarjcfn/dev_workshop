# Setting up for the workshop

## 1. Create a free account on Github:
If you haven't yet, go to [Github's sign up page](https://github.com/join) and create a free account

## 2. Download and install main sofware
 - Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/): _It's a powerful editor and we'll use it for a lot of the code, especially backend._
 - Download and install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12) via the App Store: _It's Apple's official tool for iOS app development. 100% free_
 - Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): _It's a framework that we will be using to write our backend code_
 - Install Git: _It's the software we'll be using for source control._
   - After installing Xcode, open up Terminal.app
   - Type `git status` then press `<Enter>`
   - If Git is not installed, you'll receive a prompt asking if you want do download it. Answer yes by pressing `y` and hitting `<Enter>`
   - If you see a message that says `fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git` it means that Git is installed, so nothing else to do here.

## 3. All done.
 Now you can wait for the first session (if you're doing presential workshops), or move on to [Session_1/Chapter1.md](./Session_1/Chapter1.md) (if you're reading by yourself)
