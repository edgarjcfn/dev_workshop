 # Chapter 3: Programming with Swift
 So far we have made a lot of progress. We can already make use of the terminal to issue special commands to our computer, and we've understood how git can help software developers version their source code.

 Now it's time to actually write some code!
 Like the previous session, let's not talk so much about it, and let's get our hands on.


 Disclaimer: because this workshop is aimed towards business people working at a tech startup, I'm going to make some analogies comparing our code with spreadsheets (as in Excel or Google Sheets). So if you're not really familiar with these softwares, I apologize in advance.

 I will show some examples on the text below, but you can find working code on the `Session_2/References` folder. I suggest that

 ## Exercise 1 - Declarations

 The code below shows how to store a value in a variable called `my_variable` and a constant called `my_constant`
 ```
var my_variable = 42
let my_constant = 3.1415
```

 ## Exercise 2 - Conditionals

 W.I.P.

 ## Exercise 3 - Loops

 W.I.P.
